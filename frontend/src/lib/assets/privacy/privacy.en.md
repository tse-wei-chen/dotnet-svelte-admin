# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-09-07

This Privacy Policy explains how dotnet-svelte-admin ("we", "us", or "the Project") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the project or its documentation. This is a developer-oriented, open-source project — treat this document as a template and adapt it to your application's legal needs before publishing.

## Information We Collect

- Information you provide directly: when you contact maintainers, open issues, or submit feedback, you may provide an email address, name, or other contact details.
- Automatically collected information: usage logs, IP addresses, user agent strings and other diagnostic data may be collected by hosting services, analytics tools, or our server if enabled.
- Third-party data: if you enable third‑party integrations (analytics, auth providers), those providers may collect data according to their own policies.

## How We Use Information

We use collected information to:

- respond to issues and support requests;
- improve the project and documentation;
- analyze usage patterns to prioritize features and fixes;
- comply with legal obligations.

## Cookies and Tracking

This project does not set cookies by default. If you integrate analytics or other web services, those services may use cookies or similar technologies. Review the configuration of any third-party tools you enable.

## Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell personal data. We may disclose information:

- to comply with legal process;
- to third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics), under contract and limited use;
- in aggregate or anonymized form.

## Data Retention and Security

We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described. We take reasonable measures to protect data, but no system is completely secure—you should not send sensitive secrets through issue trackers or public channels.

## Children

The project is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date. For substantial changes, we recommend notifying users via project release notes or documentation updates.

## Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or data handled by this project, open an issue or contact the maintainers through the repository contact channels.
